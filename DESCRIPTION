Description: Land Suitability Evaluation Module (LaSEM) is a modular R-based Shiny app for decision-support system for producing land suitability maps of food, horticulture, and estate crop commodities. The first version of the Shiny app aims for the suitability analysis for the biophysical factors. The application guides users in collecting and preparing data to visualize suitability maps of certain crops on an interactive map, thus bundling the workflows into a single, streamlined interface. The main feature of LaSEM is its spatially-explicit functionality and streamlined interface which allows it to automatically evaluate land suitability based on biophysical factors of specific areas using the FAO framework. This application is built upon the theory of land evaluation and suitability assessment (i.e., FAO 1976, 2007).
